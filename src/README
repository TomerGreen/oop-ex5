=============================

*  The Filter, Order and Section classes and subclasses are in a separate "commands" package. This is because they are
not directly related to file processing, and may be used for other purposes.

*  We decided to implement exceptions as nested classes of the class that throws them. This is since each exception
type is specific to the operation performed by the classes we implemented, so we don't want any other class to be able
to throw them. Exceptions of both Type I and Type II inherit from the Exception class, since they are checked errors.
The problem with this design is that it doesn't implement the hierarchy of errors. However, this hierarchy is still
implemented in how the Parser treats the different errors it catches.

*  We used constructors for abstract filter classes in order to initialize fields shared by several filter classes.
